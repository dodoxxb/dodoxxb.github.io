# üîî Brilliant Insight
- Jensen Huang (NAE fellow): "Most of the Stanford graduates have very high expectations, and you deserve to have high expectations because you came from a great school. You were very successful. You're top of your class. Obviously, you were able to pay for tuition. Then you're graduating from one of the finest institutions on the planet. You're surrounded by other kids that are just incredible. You naturally have very high expectations. People with very high expectations have very low resilience. And unfortunately, resilience matters in success. You want greatness out of them. And greatness is not intelligence, as you know. Greartness comes from character. And character isn't formed out of smart people. It's formed out of people who suffered. I wish upon you ample doses of pain and suffering." <br>Quote from <Keynote by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang at 2024 SIEPR Economic Summit> [[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEg8cOx7UZk) [[Bilibili]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Fm411f7n3/?spm_id_from=333.788&vd_source=caf200bb31b3a75aa7cfeb24203d1a53)

- [Prof. Kaiming He](https://people.csail.mit.edu/kaiming/): "I think research is about frustrations, failures, depression. It's all about the negative words you can comp up with. That's just the reality. If you haven't experienced, that means you are not ng the best research. That's just the reality. My life was just like that. I was disappointed maybe 95ÔºÖ of the time, and then I spent 5% of my time finishing that paper then I move into next cycle being depressed, frustrated, anxious until the next work come out." <br>Quote from <2023 Future Science Prize Laureates Lecture> [[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEeL5Gf4vkk) [[Bilibili]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1QN41137qC/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=cf6d3bb74a57cce30741ebabe01fec65)

- "When providing feedback to students, think very carefully about what kind of feedback is the most helpful for a student to learn and grow, what's appropriately critical and nurturing at the same time. It's not about showing off who's the smartest in the room, who knows the most literature, etc. Especially if you're in a position of power, you have to be very careful about what long term impact your feedback might have on a student's perception of the field and his/her own abilities, or whether your feedback would make him or her feel zero self worth and want to quit the field entirely." <br>Quote from <The answer of "What did your mentor say to you that still haunts you?"> [[Zhihu]](https://www.zhihu.com/question/359740428/answer/1573337616)

- [Prof. Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/): "So I think the study techniques depend very much on who you are. And I've noticed among scientists there's huge differences. So I don't like reading. I start reading something, and after I've read kind of one paragraph, I get distracted because it makes me think of something. I'm very bad at reading scientific papers. I will read important papers in the end if I have to. I love talking to people. So I've got a friend called Terry Sejnowski who loves reading. He reads all the literature in neuroscience. And if I want to know something in neuroscience, I don't actually go and read a paper. I call up Terry and he explains things to me. And that's much more fun. I guess in some ways I was fortunate to get the advisor for my PhD, who had the same kind of characteristic. And so he gave me advice early on. Don't read the literature. Reading rots the mind. First solve the problem yourself, and then look in the literature to see if your solution is novel. Now this is the exact opposite advice to what you'll get from almost all people. They'll say you should read the literature. You should carefully before you start on solving puzzles yourself, you should read the literature. I think both views are correct, because it depends on who you are. Some people like reading a lot and acquiring lots of knowledge. Other people are puzzle solvers like me, and they don't like reading lots of stuff. They like a puzzle to solve. So I think there's huge variation in how you should study." <br>Quote from <Meet a Nobel laureate: A conversation with University Professor Emeritus Geoffrey Hinton> [[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpUXI9wmKLc) [[Bilibili]](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1RnLHzGE9R/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=caf200bb31b3a75aa7cfeb24203d1a53)
